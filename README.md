# pickup_core
To help people organise competitive scrims and pickups.

I've built this so that it can be deployed via a docker container for easier deployment of future updates.

I've used IdentityServer and aspnet.security.openId.steam to handle logins. Currently still need to manually add steamId to get user details

I've used signalR to handle real-time updates to clients
